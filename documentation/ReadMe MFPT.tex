\section{Overview of functions}
\noindent\texttt{solve\_mfpt.m}: This function takes the scale factor \texttt{k} (scales with cell aspect ratio, values stored in \texttt{kValsCtrlAR1p06to2.mat}) and solves the corresponding boundary value problem for the mean first passage time (\textbf{symmetric} energy landscape). There are several possible outputs. The first is \texttt{Y1}, the solution to the BVP. The second is \texttt{Y2}, which is the mean first passage time function (i.e. \texttt{Y1} divided by the splitting probability). The third is \texttt{splitProbs}, which is the splitting probability. All of these outputs are vectors that represent the values of the respective functions evaluated at starting angles $\alpha$ (denoted by the vector \texttt{x = linspace(0,pi)}).

\noindent\texttt{solve\_mfpt\_new.m}: This function takes the scale factors \texttt{k} and \texttt{j} (scale with cell aspect ratio, values stored in \texttt{AsymmValsAR1p06to1p67.mat}) and solves the corresponding boundary value problem for the mean first passage time (\textbf{asymmetric} energy landscape). It has the same possible outputs as \texttt{solve\_mfpt.m}.
\\[3pt]

\noindent\texttt{BVPplot.m}: This function plots the desired output from \texttt{solve\_mfpt.m} or  \texttt{solve\_mfpt\_new.m} for starting angles $\alpha$ from 0 to $\pi$.
\\[3pt]

\noindent\texttt{solve\_SAB.m}: This function plots the analytical solution of the single absorbing boundary problem for an absorbing boundary at $b = \pi/2$. It plots it for all possible starting angles $\alpha \in (0,\pi/2).$
